Design patterns

Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design.
Each pattern is a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code.

What is a Design pattern?
In software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem
in software design. A design pattern isn’t a finished design that can be transformed directly into code.
It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

Patterns are often confused with algorithms because both concepts describe typical solutions to some known problems.
While an algorithm always defines a clear set of actions that can achieve some goal, a pattern is a more high-level
description of a solution. The code of the same pattern applied to two different programs may be different.

Classification of patterns:

 - Creational patterns provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

 - Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping the structures
 flexible and efficient.

 - Behavioural patterns take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
Let’s start exploring types of patterns…
